# VQA-FusionNet
VQA-FusionNet is a multimodal Visual Question Answering (VQA) framework that fuses image and text features using a combination of Vision Transformer (ViT) and BERT. It enables models to interpret an image and answer natural language questions about it â€” bridging the gap between visual understanding and language comprehension.
